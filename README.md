- Implemented an abstract Item class and created derived classes such as AppleItem and OrangeItem, which can be collected into the inventory.
- Added an Observer pattern in GameManager so that when the player collects inventory items or frozen enemies, they are added to the inventory.
- Integrated the Observer pattern in GameManager to update game UI and play sound effects when the player collects coins, obtains a big reward, or takes damage from enemies.
- Designed enemy behavior patterns using the IEnemyState interface, creating multiple state classes such as WaitState and AttackState.
